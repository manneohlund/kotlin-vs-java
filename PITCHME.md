An language feature battle

### Why Kotlin?
Kotlin fixes a series of issues that Java suffers from

@ul

- Null references are controlled by the type system.
- No raw types
- Arrays in Kotlin are invariant
- Kotlin has proper function types, as opposed to Java's SAM-conversions
- Use-site variance without wildcards
- Kotlin does not have checked exceptions

@ulend

### What Kotlin has that Java does not

@ul

- Null-safety
- Lambda expressions + Inline functions = performant custom control structures
- Extension functions
- Smart casts
- String templates
- Properties
- Primary constructors
- First-class delegation
- Type inference for variable and property types
- Singletons
- Declaration-site variance & Type projections
- Range expressions
- Operator overloading
- Companion objects
- Data classes
- Separate interfaces for read-only and mutable collections
- Coroutines

### What Java has that Kotlin does not

@ul

- Checked exceptions
- Primitive types that are not classes
- Static members
- Non-private fields
- Wildcard-types
- Ternary-operator a ? b : c

@ulend

###### Syntax

Kotlin

```Kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
  println("Hello, ${args[0]}")
}
```

Java

```java
public static final void main(String[] args) {
  System.out.println(String.format("Hello, %s", args[0]))
}
```
